In Summer 2020 I was a co-instructor for Data 8, the first course in the data science sequence at UC Berkeley. The course enrolled 450 students from nearly every department on campus. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was held entirely online through both synchronous and asynchronous sessions.

As co-instructor, I:
* Lectured on topics relating to python programming, statistical inference, and machine learning
* Developed a lecture series on human contexts and ethics in data science, to illustrate the prevalence of data science in current events and encourage students to critically analyze widespread predictive algorithms
* Co-authored a data exploration final project that assessed knowledge of the data science lifecycle through student-directed analyses
* Managed a course staff of 15 teaching assistants and 15 group tutors
