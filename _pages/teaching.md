Throughout my academic career, I've leveraged my unique training in both epidemiology and data science to teach computational tools to population health researchers. I've taught courses and designed curriculum for undergraduate and graduate levels at both [UC Berkeley](#berkeley) and [Stanford University](#stanford). 

## UC Berkeley<a name="berkeley"></a>

During my time at UC Berkeley, I had the opportunity to teach in the [College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/). Through my teaching efforts, I received the [Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/ogsi-2021/) for Statistics in 2021 and the [Extraordinary Teaching in Extraordinary Times Award](https://rtl.berkeley.edu/extraordinary-teaching-extraordinary-times-award) in 2020

I was an Undergraduate Student Instructor for **Foundations of Data Science** ([Data 8](www.data8.org)) for 5 semesters, including a semester as the Head TA of Course Logistics and a semester as the Head TA of Content and Assessments. I co-instructed the course in [Summer 2020](https://www.data8.org/su20/) with 450 enrolled students, and managed a staff of 15 TAs and 15 tutors. The course covered topics in python programming, data visualization, conditional probability, hypothesis testing, bootstrap sampling, regression, and classification.

I was a Head Graduate Student Instructor for **Probability for Data Science** ([Data 140](http://prob140.org/)) for 3 semesters. The course covered topics in probability distributions, expectation, markov chain monte carlo, variance/covariance, multiple linear regression, and estimation using MAP and MLE. 

Within the School of Public Health, I helped develop and teach R programming materials for **Epidemiological Methods II** (Public Health W250FG). 

## Stanford University<a name="stanford"></a>

I currently co-instruct **R Fundamentals for Health Research** (EPI/CHPR 202), an introductory course in R programming for masters- and PhD-level students with an enrollment of 45 students. The course covers topics in R syntax, tidyverse, data visualizations (ggplot), statistical testing, and regression. 

In Winter 2021, I was a TA for **Intermediate Epidemiological Methods** (EPI 202), which covered topics in study designs, population sampling, and causal inference.

I have also been a near-peer mentor and R teaching assistant for the [Stanford Advancing Health Equity and Diversity (AHEaD)](https://med.stanford.edu/epidemiology-dept/other-programs/summer-internship-program.html) program
