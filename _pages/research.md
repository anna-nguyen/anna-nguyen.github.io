## Child Growth Failure<a name="growth-failure"></a>

Current estimates of global child growth faltering rely on cross-sectional data, but little is known about the timing and recurrence of stunting and wasting. Our team found that the highest incidence of child wasting and stunting happened within the first three months of life and that early growth faltering was associated with persistent growth faltering.

## Influence of Weather on Enteric Pathogens and WASH Interventions<a name="weather"></a>

Our group previously found that low-cost, point-of care water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions did not have substantial effects on enteric disease. In a series of follow-up studies, we found that environmental conditions influence the prevalence of enteropathogens, efficacy of WASH interventions, and contamination pathways.

## School-Based Influenza Vaccinations<a name="vaccines"></a>

Children are super-spreaders of influenza, largely due to high contact rates with their peers in school settings. Increasing vaccination rates among children might lower the burden of influenza by directly preventing infections in the age group and indirectly reducing transmission in the broader community. Our team found that a school-based influenza vaccination program was associated with higher school-aged vaccination, lower school absenteeism, and all-age hospitalizations in the community, but that  differences in program impact by race/ethnicity.

## Epidemiological Methods for Infectious Diseases<a name="methods"></a>
Traditional statistical methods often make parametric assumptions that cannot be assessed when transmission dynamics are not well defined, such as in emerging disease and disease elimination settings. To better understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases, we can apply novel techniques that leverage advances in statistics and computing.

## Reproducibility<a name="reproducibility"></a>

In my research, I maintain reproducible computational workflows and regularly publish analysis code on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/anna-nguyen/). I have also contributed to the [Benjamin-Chung Lab Manual](https://jadebc.github.io/lab-manual/) which outlines best practices for transparency and reproducibility in computational epidemiology, and have written an invited commentary on rigor and reproducibility for *Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology*.
