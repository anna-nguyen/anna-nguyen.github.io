Hello! I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University in the [Department of Epidemiology and Population Health](https://med.stanford.edu/epidemiology-dept.html) under the mentorship of [Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung](https://jadebc.net/). My research is in infectious disease epidemiology, and my dissertation focuses on assessing the effects of malaria interventions on child growth using causal mediation techniques. I am grateful to be funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (via an [F31 award](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/FKDy5KohAUuzrhASoRlqaA/project-details/10901755#description)) and the [Stanford Data Science Scholars](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program) program. 

I received my MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and my BA in Public Health and Data Science from the University of California, Berkeley. During my time at Cal, I taught in the [Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/) and designed human-centered health technologies as part of the [Fung Fellowship](https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/).

I previously worked as a data scientist at [Interwell Health](https://www.interwellhealth.com/) (formally Cricket Health), where I contributed to predictive models that project the risk of chronic kidney disease in large, diverse patient populations.
