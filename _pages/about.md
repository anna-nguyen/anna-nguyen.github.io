Hello! I am a PhD student at Stanford University in the [Department of Epidemiology and Population Health](https://med.stanford.edu/epidemiology-dept.html) under the mentorship of [Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jadebc). My research is in infectious disease epidemiology, with a focus on vaccine interventions and environmental risk factors.

I also work part-time as a data scientist at [Cricket Health](https://www.crickethealth.com/), where I contribute to predictive models that project the risk of chronic kidney disease in large, diverse patient populations.  

I received my MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and my BA in Public Health and Data Science from the University of California, Berkeley. During my time at Cal, I taught in the [Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/) and designed human-centered health technologies as part of the [Fung Fellowship](https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/).
